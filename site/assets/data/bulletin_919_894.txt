               SYNOPSIS:

                     Three 12 storey frame-shear wall buildings with varying wall size were
               designed according to capacity design principles.    Their response to the
               El Centro NS 1940 and Pacoima Dam S15°W 1970 accelerograms was investigated
               using a 2-dimensional nonlinear dynamic analysis program.    Particularly
               significant observations were the high levels of wall shear forces and
               generally low levels of column bending moment encountered.   Widespread
               beam flexural yielding involving moderate levels of inelastic deformations
               and interstorey drifts controlled by the walls indicate the potentially
               desirable inelastic performance of these hybrid structures.    Design
               schemes are proposed whereby improved estimation of maximum inelastic
               actions can be made using the traditional elastic analysis for equivalent
               lateral static loading on the structure.
