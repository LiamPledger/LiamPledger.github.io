      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering with 1st Class Honors from the University of
        Canterbury and completed my PhD from 2022 to 2025, also at the University of Canterbury. My dissertation
        quantified how reducing design drift limits for structures influences the performance of the building and
        contents by (a) assimilating data from field reconnaissance (b) conducting large-scale dynamic tests of
        non-structural elements, and (c) performing nonlinear dynamic analyses of structures to estimate the collapse
        probability, upfront cost, and seismic loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now work as a post-doctoral researcher at ETH Zurich within the chair of Structural Dynamics and Earthquake
        Engineering. My current research involves performing large-scale cyclic tests of squat T-shaped and L-shaped
        RC walls to quantify the behaviour and failure-modes of such walls and to evaluate modelling techniques for
        complex wall configurations.
